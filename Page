  <p> You choose to fight the animal. You still can't see it clearly enough to get a grasp on what it is (which is weird because you have nearly perfect vision), but you can tell it's quick and strong. </p>
  <p> As you are fighting it aims for your limbs. *Chomp* It takes a bite out of your arm. *Slash* It makes a gash across your inner thigh. *Bang* It rams it's shoulder into your knee.
  <p> As you defeat the animal with your bare hands, you are severly damaged. And now, you can finally see what the animal is. It's almost as if there was a blur that faded away. But it's now a wolf. A very beaten and bloody one (from your doing). </p>
  <p> Well, you don't have time to mourne. You are bleeding out from all of your wounds, and quickly. </p> 
  <p> Now it is time to journey forwards. </p>
